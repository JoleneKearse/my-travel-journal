      "Yes, I lived in the city at the center of the pandemic! But, don't worry, I moved away in 2005. This was my first Chinese city, one that straddles the Yangtze River. It was also the place where I really realized how many people there are in China! I went to the Walmart one Saturday. First big difference was that it was on multiple floors. I remember feeling claustrophobic and walking around and around the fourth floor desperately looking for an exit!",
