      "It is a must-see, so I did, but was definitely not my favourite place in China. I did see all the sites though, like the Forbidden City (and was disappointed the Starbucks was closed), The Summer Palace (where I joined all the other tourists climbing the sign saying don't skate on the ice to skate on the ice), and, of course, The Great Wall. I kept running up and up and up, but could never reach the top! I also got my picture taken beside the 'Now you are a real man' sign and thus became a real man.",
