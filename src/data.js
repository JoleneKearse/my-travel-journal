      "Shenzhen became my beloved Chinese hometown - I even moved back home after some travels! <<< It was a great place to meet people from all over the world and from other areas in the mainland since it's a migrant city. What started out as a collection of small villages spawned into a metropolis of around 20 million (unoffically). <<< I loved the small town feel of the Shekou neighbourhood, where all the expats knew each other. And how you could use the extensive public transportation system to reach the giant city with it's LED-lite skyscrappers with ease.",

Everytime I crossed the border, I breeved a bref of fresh air! While I loved living in China, it was a relief to visit a city-state that was Westernized. I loved the pub culture, hanging out on the TST waterfront, taking the Star Ferry, and visiting Lantao Island.",
